    "The basic idea is to find a decision boundary that not only separates the classes but stays as far away from the closest training instances as possible. Thus, a SVM tries to build the widest street possible between the classes (**large margin classification**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft Margin Classification**\n",
    "Since it is not always possible to find a decision boundary that perfectly separates the classes and has a wide margin (for example when there are outliers), we can build a more flexible model that allows for instances to end up \"in the middle of the road\" or on the other side (which is a **margin violation**) but still tries to keep the road as wide as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **hyperparameter C** is used to control how wide the street will be and thus influences the amount of margin error. Again, we have a trade-off: a model with only a few margin violations might generalize worse than one with a wider street and more violations."
